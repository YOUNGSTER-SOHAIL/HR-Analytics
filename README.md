# HR-Analytics Dashboard

Created an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, focused on analyzing employee attrition and workforce trends.

This dashboard provides key insights such as:

Total Employees & Attrition Count

Attrition Rate (16.1%)

Attrition breakdown by Age, Salary, Gender, Education & Job Role

Average Salary, Age, and Years at Company

Identification of high-risk employee segments

The goal of this project was to transform raw HR data into meaningful visual insights that can support better decision-making in workforce planning and retention strategies.

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:

Data Cleaning & Analysis

Power BI Dashboard Design

HR Metrics & KPI Reporting

Business Insight Generation

I’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions!
